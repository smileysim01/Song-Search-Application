# Song-Search-Application

About:  Users can find the titles, performing artists, and publication years for songs by searching for individual words in song      titles. A Hash Table was used to associate individual words from the titles of songs (keys) with lists of songs that contain that word in their title (values). Users might also use this application as kind of trivia game by searching for years or artists associated with a particular title word, and then competing to see who can match those years or artists with the full titles of their respective songs.

My role during this project was a Backend Developer. 
The job of the SearchBackEnd.java file is to be able to add, store, and search for songs based on a given song title, artist, or the year that the song was released. Because it is crucial to have a good performance and efficiency in the scheme of the project, executing a hash function when inserting and searching for a song by assigning a search key to each song will reduce the complexity and the time to search to a high degree.
My key role was building the technology needed to power the components which enable the user-facing side of the application to exist. My back end code adds utility to everything the front-end developer creates. I was responsible for creating, maintaining, testing, and debugging the entire back end.
